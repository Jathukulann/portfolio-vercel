This is looking fantastic! The hero section and the overall aesthetic are perfect. Now, let's build out the rest of the portfolio with my detailed information.

Remember, the goal is to continue building this as a high-quality digital product, guided by the principles in our blueprint: a strong narrative, meaningful interactions, and an impactful presentation of my work.

Please proceed with creating the following sections in order, using the content I'm providing below.

---

### **1. "About Me" Section**

Create a new section directly below the hero section. It should have a two-column layout.

* **On one side:** Please use the profile picture I uploaded earlier.
* **On the other side:** Add the heading "About Me" and use the following text:
    > "Dedicated Computer Science undergraduate with 2+ years of hands-on experience in full-stack development and software engineering. Proven track record in delivering scalable web applications using modern technologies including React, Node.js, Java, and cloud platforms. Demonstrates strong leadership capabilities through team management roles and mentoring experience, combined with exceptional problem-solving skills and adaptability to emerging technologies."

### **2. "My Tech Stack" Section**

### **3. "Featured Projects" Section**

This is the most important section. Please create a grid of **four** `ProjectCard` components. Each card should display the project title, a short description, the tech stack, and a "View Case Study" button.

* **Project 1: Alphintra**
    * **Description:** A cloud-native algorithmic trading platform with a no-code strategy builder.

### **4. "Experience & Leadership" Section**

Create a new section titled "Career Journey" or "Experience & Leadership." A clean, vertical timeline component would be a great way to visualize this information.

* **Vice President - Hindu Society, University of Colombo** (Feb 2025 - Present)
* **Manager - Thurka Metal Crushers** (May 2022 - Mar 2023)
* **IGV-CXP Team Member - AIESEC** (Jan 2024 - Jul 2024)

### **5. "Get In Touch" Section & Footer**

Finally, create the contact section at the bottom of the page.

* Include a clear heading like "Let's Connect."
* Add a short paragraph below the heading: "I'm always open to discussing new projects, creative ideas, or opportunities to be part of an ambitious team. Feel free to reach out for my full resume or to start a conversation."
* Display my contact details with clickable icons:
    * Email: `jathukulan.sivanathan@gmail.com`
    * Phone: `+94778781792`
    * LinkedIn & GitHub (please find the links from my CV)

### **Final Instructions**

* **Consistency:** Please ensure all new sections use the same on-scroll reveal animations that you've established.
* **Interactivity:** The custom cursor and magnetic button effects should apply to all new interactive elements (links, buttons, project cards).

Thank you! Please proceed with implementing these sections.
